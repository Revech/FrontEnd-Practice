# E-Commerce Frontend Website

This project is a front-end e-commerce website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The design and styling closely resemble the Amazon website. It showcases different programming concepts, methodologies, and tools, all well-documented and explained with comments throughout the code.

## Features and Technologies Used

### 1. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
   - Basic structure is created using **HTML**.
   - **CSS** is used for styling, clone of Amazonâ€™s layout.
   - **JavaScript** is used for dynamic functionality and interactions.

### 2. **Modules**
   - Code is organized into reusable **modules** for better maintainability and scalability.
   - Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as handling products, cart functionality, and more.

### 3. **External Libraries**
   - External JavaScript libraries have been used to streamline development and enhance functionality.
   - Examples of these libraries are provided within the project.

### 4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **Classes** and **inheritance** are used to create objects for products, user management, and shopping cart functionalities.
   - Encapsulation is used to hide the internal workings of certain functionalities, keeping the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

### 5. **Backend Integration and Data Handling**
   - The website demonstrates data fetching from a backend using **Promises** and **Async/Await**.
   - **JSON** is used for data exchange between the frontend and backend.
   - Examples are provided in the code comments on how data is fetched using different approaches.

### 6. **Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await**
   - **Callbacks** are used in handling asynchronous operations.
   - **Promises** and **Async/Await** are used to handle asynchronous requests for fetching data from the backend.
   - Different examples of these concepts are explained and commented in the code.

### 7. **MVC and Procedural Approaches**
   - This project demonstrates two programming approaches:
     1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to separate concerns and organize code logically.
     2. **Procedural approach** where the code executes in a step-by-step manner.
   - Each approach is implemented in different sections of the project to show the differences and advantages of each.

### 8. **Testing and Testing Frameworks**
   - Basic testing has been set up to ensure the functionality of key components.
   - Testing frameworks and tools are utilized to automate the testing process.
   - Test cases cover essential parts like data fetching, product manipulation, and cart functionalities.

### 9. **Encapsulation**
   - examples of encapsulation is provided in the comment section

### 10. Enjoy the Trip :)
